# pomodoro

This is a productivity and learning tool to provide a framework for short sprints of focus followed by a brief summarization of learning done, concepts covered, or tasks completed during the sprint. 

This is a tool inspired by the "pomodoro technique" as explained in this short video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pADI_eZ_-U. I found that the summary aspect was a great way to adapt this method to meet the needs and imporve the effectiveness of a student looking to improve study habits and skills. 

This current version is my first iteration of this application. As I have built the basic framework for the tool I have jotted down ideas and aspirations for future iterations. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out with any questions/suggestions you may have.
