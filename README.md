# pomodoro


## http://pomodoro.chadjayholmes
This is a productivity and learning tool designed to provide a productivity model that calls for short sprints of focus followed by a brief summarization of learning done, concepts covered, or tasks completed during the sprint. This tool is inspired by the "Pomodoro Technique" as explained in this short video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pADI_eZ_-U. I found that the summary aspect, although not a part of the official Pomodoro technique, was a great way to adapt this method to meet the needs of the student looking to improve study habits, skills and focus capabilities. 

The idea and original inpsiration for the project came about as I was looking for ways to improve my study habits and my productivity, not necesarilly looking for protfolio building projects. As I have worked on the project and searched for artistic inspiration I have been made very aware that this is a popular app to build as one learns the ropes of web design. However, no tutorials or walkthroughs were used in the creation of this project. Just a dude trying to get better at studying, focusing and being productive and it just so happens its helping me learn some development principles. 

This current version is my first iteration of this application. As I have gone through the basic design and logic for the foundation of the tool I have jotted down ideas and aspirations for future iterations. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out with any questions/suggestions you may have.
